# Advent of Code 2020

**SPOILER ALERT**

These are my solutions for the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I'm trying to learn Julia and this is a fun way to develop my skills.
Solutions may not be the best possible way to solve the problems.

I may also run out of time later this month.

## Structure

* This directory contains scripts; one script corresponds to the puzzle for a single day
* `inputs` contains my custom puzzle inputs -- yours will be different
* `demo` contains the demo inputs -- the problem statement gives the solution for demo inputs, and so making sure that your code works on these demo inputs is helpful
