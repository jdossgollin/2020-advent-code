## My Solutions for Advent of Code 2020

These are my solutions for the 2020 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
I'm trying to learn Julia and this is a fun way to develop my skills.

All solutions are my own, but I'm also learning a lot by checking out more performant solutions on Zulip at https://julialang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/265470-advent-of-code.

## Structure

* This directory contains scripts; one script corresponds to the puzzle for a single day
* `inputs` contains my custom puzzle inputs -- yours will be different
* `demo` contains the demo inputs -- the problem statement gives the solution for demo inputs, and so making sure that your code works on these demo inputs is helpful
